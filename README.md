# Uber Data Analytics | Data Engineering GCP Project

 End-to-end Data Pipeline & Analytics on Uber Trips using GCP, Mage, BigQuery & Looker Studio.


## Overview

This project aims to analyze Uber datasets by leveraging a combination of cloud-based tools and advanced analytics technologies. The workflow incorporates data storage and management using **GCP Storage**, data processing and transformation with **Python** and **Mage Data Pipeline Tool**, and scalable computing via **Compute Engine**. The processed data is then analyzed and queried using **BigQuery**, with visualizations and insights presented through **Looker Studio**.
The objective is to derive meaningful insights, optimize workflows, and demonstrate the integration of various tools for end-to-end data analytics.


 ## Architecture 

The goal of this project is to build a modern data pipeline for analyzing Uber trip records. The pipeline involves:
1. Extracting & loading data from NYC’s open taxi dataset
2.  Processing & transforming using Mage (ELT tool)
3. Storing & querying using BigQuery
4. Visualizing using Looker Studio


## Technology Stack
### Programming Language : 
    Python
### Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Services :
1. Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
2. Compute Engine
3. BigQuery
4. Looker Studio
 ### Data Pipeline Tool : 
     Mage.ai

## Dataset Used
We use NYC TLC Trip Record Data, which contains Uber ride details, including:
1. Pick-up & drop-off locations (Latitude/Longitude)
2. Trip timestamps
3. Trip distance
4. Fares, payment types
5. Passenger counts
