# Uber Data Analytics

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Uber datasets by leveraging a combination of cloud-based tools and advanced analytics technologies. The workflow incorporates data storage and management using **GCP Storage**, data processing and transformation with **Python** and **Mage Data Pipeline Tool**, and scalable computing via **Compute Engine**. The processed data is then analyzed and queried using **BigQuery**, with visualizations and insights presented through **Looker Studio**. The objective is to derive meaningful insights, optimize workflows, and demonstrate the integration of various tools for end-to-end data analytics.


## Dataset Used
We use NYC TLC Trip Record Data, which contains Uber ride details, including:
1. Pick-up & drop-off locations (Latitude/Longitude)
2. Trip timestamps
3. Trip distance
4. Fares, payment types
5. Passenger counts
